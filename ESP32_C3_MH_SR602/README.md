# Blink Example

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

This README is a leftover from the ESP-IDF Blink example. See `ESP32_C3_IOT_TEMPLATE.md` for the actual project documentation.

## How to Use Example

Before project configuration and build, be sure to set the correct chip target using `idf.py set-target <chip_name>`.

### Hardware Required

* A development board with normal LED or addressable LED on-board (e.g., ESP32-S3-DevKitC, ESP32-C6-DevKitC etc.)
* A USB cable for Power supply and programming

See [Development Boards](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits) for more information about it.

### Configure the Project

Open the project configuration menu (`idf.py menuconfig`).

In the `Example Configuration` menu:

* Select the LED type in the `Blink LED type` option.
  * Use `GPIO` for regular LED
  * Use `LED strip` for addressable LED
* If the LED type is `LED strip`, select the backend peripheral
  * `RMT` is only available for ESP targets with RMT peripheral supported
  * `SPI` is available for all ESP targets
* Set the GPIO number used for the signal in the `Blink GPIO number` option.
* Set the blinking period in the `Blink period in ms` option.

### Build and Flash

Run `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Example Output

As you run the firmware in this repo, the onboard LED is controlled by `main/led_indicator.c` (simple GPIO patterns) and the device provides provisioning + status UI.

```text
I (315) example: Example configured to blink addressable LED!
I (325) example: Turning the LED OFF!
I (1325) example: Turning the LED ON!
I (2325) example: Turning the LED OFF!
I (3325) example: Turning the LED ON!
I (4325) example: Turning the LED OFF!
I (5325) example: Turning the LED ON!
I (6325) example: Turning the LED OFF!
I (7325) example: Turning the LED ON!
I (8325) example: Turning the LED OFF!
```

Note: The color order could be different according to the LED model.

The pixel number indicates the pixel position in the LED strip. For a single LED, use 0.

## Troubleshooting

* If the LED isn't blinking, check the GPIO or the LED type selection in the `Example Configuration` menu.
